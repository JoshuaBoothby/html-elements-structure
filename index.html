        <pre>
Last session the edgerunners escaped from a lone FBC ( Full body conversion ) Maxtac agent. 



The crews strongest and most beloved member Meet Bal sacrificed himself to hold off the borg already suffering from 

Cyberpsychosis.




The last the crew sees is the 2 of them facing off in a warehouse full of corpses as they are driving away.</pre

        <h2>Beginning of Encounter</h2>
        <p>
          The crew is riding in their nomad's heavily modified Vehicle ( compact
          ground car with 70 sdp(hit points) 8 seats 20 movement 13 armor NOS
          and a combat plow)
        </p>
        <p>
          The crew is driving through the heywood industrial zone when a clown
          suddenly falls from the sky and lands on the hood of the car violently
          bouncing and rolling up and over the car as more clowns start falling
          in front, around, and on top of the the crew.
        </p>
        <p>
          ( 1d6 clowns per round, base dv 10 increaseing by 1 per clown rolled,
          and increaseing by 1 per round. 2d6+4 damage per clown that lands on
          the car)
        </p>
        <p>
          The clowns are unarmed and all of the ones falling from the sky have
          their mouthes sewn shut. they are all exoticly biosculpted to look
          permanently like clowns.(no combat cyberware)
        </p>

        <p>
          Use the booster stats from the core rules for the clowns just take
          away their weapons and give them a 1d6+2 damage punch attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the crew looks up they see a trama team AV4 covered in Bozos and
          trying to fight the clowns off a security guard get thrown from the av
          and lands under the crews car as it is driving causing them to need to
          make on last driving skill check to avoid a crash. As the av4 finally
          looses control and spirals off into the distance flinging clowns in
          all directions as it crashes into a building.

        <h2>Clownnaught</h2>
        <p>
          Just when the crew thinks that they have made it away they hear the
          loud echoing music jingle of an Ice cream truck coming up behind them.
        </p>
        <div>
          The ice cream truck is a heavily armored and weaponized vehicle that
          appears to be an old ice cream truck that has been welded to a school
          bus and heavily modified into a rolling fortress. The truck is painted
          in bright colors and has a large clown face painted on the front of
          it. The truck is covered in spikes and blades and has a large cannon
          mounted on the top of it, and as half a dozen av engines attached to
          make it hover. The truck is driven by a large clown wearing a bright
          red suit and a top hat(this bozo has a body of 10 and grafted muscle
          and bone lace so he is able to pilot the bucking bronco that is a
          punknaught siege vehicle without being bludgeoned to death in the
          process). The vehicle has an sdp of 100 and a movement of 20 but it is
          gaining on the crew. The clownnaught is armed with an acid paintball
          launcher, a Clownapault and has 27 bozos on it that it can use as ammo
          for the clownapault. The cannon is blasting synth coke straight up
          into the air.
        </div>
        <p>
          If an edgerunner is able to get on top of the clownnaught they will be
          challenged to a duel by the clown in charge and if they win or violate
          the 1v1 the other bozos with attempt to gang up on and load the
          edgerunner into the catapult and launch them in the opposite direction
          of the crew. Unless they have two Cyberlegs, the person being launched
          must succeed at a DV 15 Athletics Check when they land or suffer 2d6
          damage directly to their HP. Also it will send them flying directly
          through the synth coke cloud.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>End of Encounter</h2>
        <p>
          The crew is able to escape the clownnaught by driving into a tunnel
          that is too small for the clownnaught to fit into where they are able
          to lose the clowns in the maze of the industrial zone. If they out run
          the clownnaught.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the crew is able to defeat the clownnaught roll on the punknaught
          death table. and award the crew with 50 gip and 4 rep.
